# Walk and Talk

Walk and Talk is a mobile application that brings together women in menopause transition or postmenopause who are interested to try walking as a means to socialize and to alleviate their symptoms.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure
Walk and Talk is divided into two directories: the frontend and backend. React-native is used to develop the frontend with nodejs/express/sequalize stack used to develop the backend. It also includes the integration of RedCap (a 3rd party API for healthcare database) and Cybera as our server host.

- backend 
    - api - for controllers, models, services, etc
    - config - for routes, database, etc.
    - db - contains the sqlite database
    - test - contains all tests, uses [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)
- walkandtalk 
    - android - java compiled JS code
    - ios - c# compiled JS code
    - test - contains all tests
    - src - holds the below directories and a main/navigation file
        - actions - performs redux logic for models

        - reducers - redux
